									<h2>Other Interests</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="icon solid fa-hand-rock fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock Climbing</span><br>
								<p>
									Rock climbing is a recent passion of mine, but one I have dedicated significant time to recently. I
									enjoy both the problem solving aspect - how do you move your body to progress upwards - as well as 
									the strength and coordination it requires. I have learned to lead climb and am
									looking forward to climbing bolted routes nearby my city, with the goal of climbing a 5.10 by the summer.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-map fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiking & Backpacking</span><br>
								<p>
									Since my time in Boy Scouts I have been an avid hiker. Backpacking was never as much of a passion of
									mine, but my interest in returning to it grew during pandemic lockdown. My partner, our dog, and I have
									begun backpacking again with a goal of completing a rim to rim trip of the Grand Canyon.
								</p>	
								<span class="icon solid fa-tree fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archery</span><br>
								<p>
									Archery is a sport I was also introduced to during my time in Scouts and quickly grew to love.
									I find something more enticing with archery than other shooting sports - there is something very
									primal about shooting a bow. I would like to do more 3D shooting, though it has been years since I last did.
								</p>	
								<span class="icon solid fa-utensils fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking</span><br>
								<p>
									Cooking began as a necessity, not an interest. In college my roommate and I were living
									on our own, and had to feed ourselves. Since money was tight, eating out regularly was
									not an option. We began teaching ourselves how to cook, and became quite good as college
									progressed. I now cook both to eat healthy and to enjoy foods that I love, with recent 
									recipes including Pad Thai, Felafel, Turkey with Red Chili Sauce, and Sous Vide Filet Minon,
									to name a few. I have also become quite good recently with my Latte machine.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-dumbbell fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weightlifting</span><br>
								<p>
									Weightlifting is a necessary training to gain and maintain the strength I need for other
									activities, like archery and rock climbing. Beyond that my regular visits to the gym organize
									my day and motivate me. My current weightlifting goal is to build strength,
									increasing the weight for compound lifts to help improve my rock climbing.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-dice fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Games</span><br>
								<p>
									During graduate school, Dungeons and Dragons served as an important outlet for me and members
									of my research lab to unwind. I first played D&D as a child and have loved it ever since. I
									also enjoy a great variety of games, from strategy games to first person shooters.
