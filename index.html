									<h2>About</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have always had a strong desire to understand the world. I have a 
									passion for math and science as instruments for that understanding, and
									read widely on these topics throughout my life. I wrote my first line of
									code as a member of my high school Robotics team, and have been pursuing
									it as a process for understanding how to think ever since. My appetite for
									learning is just as strong today, and I am interested in a wide variety of
									topics. I am always interested in solving unique and challenging problems,
									usually with the aid of computer. If you have any such problems, contact me!

									<h2>Work</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									I have a wide variety of academic and work interests, and have run the gamut of
									computer science subfields. I have a deep interest in computer security and the
									methods for protecting users data. I greatly enjoy the process of analyzing
									programs from an attackers view and finding creative solution to find and patch
									vulnerabilities. Ultimately my interest in Computer Science is a philosophical
									one of how to think through problems and answer tough questions. This belongs to
									no single domain of Computer Science, nor is it exclusive to Computer Science. As
									such, any work that involves tough questions requiring methodical solutions is of
									interest to me.

											Computer Security
										</div>
										<div class="col-12">
											In graduate school, I worked with the <a href="https://sefcom.asu.edu/">Security Engineering for Future
											Computing (SEFCOM)</a> lab for my thesis and significant coursework. In classes led by SEFCOM faculty,
											I learned the techniques for binary, web, and  network security. This included techniques like Buffer
											Overflows, Format String exploits, Loop Overflows (Off-by-One exploits), Return Oriented Programming,
											Spoofing (ARP, IP, TCP), Cross Site Scripting, and SQL Injection. I also learned the use of binary
											reverse engineering tools like Ada. These techniques were employed with the Capture the Flag (CTF) team
											the pwndevils. Pwndevils was established by Shellphish alumni and worked closely with the team, frequently
											attending DEFCOM CTF events with them. My research project for my thesis was the application of inductive
											programming techniques to exploit generation, which enabled the learning of basic expoits from examples
											in a CTF environment. This research is ongoing and pending future publication. My current role with
											Censys involves development of the Attack Surface Management Risks platform, which enables users to 
											identify vulnerabilities in their internet facing devices.

										<div class="col-12">
											Artificial Intelligence
										</div>
										<div class="col-12">
											During both my undergaduate and graduate degree I took multiple courses in artificial intelligence
											techniques, including heuristic searches, classifiers, clustering, and reinforcement learning. My
											graduate work included the mathematical foundations for algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic
											Regression, Locality Sensitive Hashing, and Markov Decision Processes. My employment with the Navy
											involved the development of genetic algorithms to optimize aircraft Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
											(TTPs). In my current employment with the Army, I have developed a navigation system which generates
											a graph data structure from the terrain to enable intelligent path identification via heuristic
											searches, like A* and Djikstra, and optimization techniques like Ant Colony Optimization. I have
											also developed an architecture for Utility-driven AI which is used to define adaptive behaviors. The
											methodology for my thesis research, inductive programming, an AI technique that uses Directed
											Acyclic Graph (DAG) intersections to learn from examples.

										<div class="col-12">
											My professional career has been spent with the Department of Defense working in the field of 
											Computational Sciences, specifically Combat Modeling. My first job with the Navy involved development
											of a deterministic, closed-form simulation used to evaluate aircraft Tactics, Techniques, and
											Procedures (TTPs). This simulation mutated Subject Matter Expert (SME) encoded strategies across
											a variety of scenarios to evaluate effectiveness of alternative TTPs. Our work involved not only
											algorithm development but the maintenance of the two hundred node, Windows Server cluster computer
											on which they were run. My work included performing updates and developing utilities for job
											submission and server maintenance. My current job is working on an Army closed-form, Monte Carlo, 
											discrete event combat simulator used for analysis of acquisition decisions. I have worked on defining
											automated and intelligent behaviors for entities within the simulation as well as extending the
											simulation to model new functionalities.

										<div class="col-12">
											Functional Programming
										</div>
										<div class="col-12">
											Since learning functional programming, I employ its techniques with growing regularity as a useful
											methodology for solving data transformation driven problems. Clojure is the most functional programming
											language I have used, but I reguarly apply the functional programming features of languages like Python
											and Java to create simpler solutions. The navigation suite I developed for the Army is mostly functional,
											with a Graph object that merely manages basic state information and all other methods being written
											independent of the object. This has the extra benefit of enabling these methods to be repurposed by other
											developers, who have used the resulting library for various projects. As part of my functional paradigm
											exploration, I studied Okasaki's foundational paper Purely Functional Data Structures, and utilize his
											techniques regularly to improve my code (lazy evaluation, memoization, and immutability).

								<header>
									<h2>Other Interests</h2>
								</header>
								<span class="icon solid fa-mountain fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Rock Climbing</span><br>
								<p>
									Rock climbing is a recent passion of mine, but one I have dedicated significant time to recently. I
									enjoy both the problem solving aspect - how do you move your body to progress upwards - as well as 
									the strength and coordination it requires. I have learned to lead climb and am
									looking forward to climbing bolted routes nearby my city, with the goal of climbing a 5.10 by the summer.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-map fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Hiking & Backpacking</span><br>
								<p>
									Since my time in Boy Scouts I have been an avid hiker. Backpacking was never as much of a passion of
									mine, but my interest in returning to it grew during pandemic lockdown. My partner, our dog, and I have
									begun backpacking again with a goal of completing a rim to rim trip of the Grand Canyon.
								</p>	
								<span class="icon solid fa-bullseye fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Archery</span><br>
								<p>
									Archery is a sport I was also introduced to during my time in Scouts and quickly grew to love.
									I find something more enticing with archery than other shooting sports - there is something very
									primal about shooting a bow. I would like to do more 3D shooting in the future.
								</p>	
								<span class="icon solid fa-utensils fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Cooking</span><br>
								<p>
									Cooking began as a necessity, not an interest. In college my roommate and I were living
									on our own, and had to feed ourselves. Since money was tight, eating out regularly was
									not an option. We began teaching ourselves how to cook, and became quite good as college
									progressed. I now cook both to eat healthy and to enjoy foods that I love, with recent 
									recipes including Pad Thai, Falafel, Turkey with Red Chili Sauce, and Sous Vide Filet Minon,
									to name a few. I have also become quite good recently with my Latte machine.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-dumbbell fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Weightlifting</span><br>
								<p>
									Weightlifting is a necessary training to gain and maintain the strength I need for other
									activities, like archery and rock climbing. Beyond that my regular visits to the gym organize
									my day and motivate me. My current weightlifting goal is to build strength,
									increasing the weight for compound lifts to help improve my rock climbing.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-balance-scale fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Philosophy</span><br>
								<p>
									I have a keen interest in philosophy, especially the practical philosophies of the Hellenistic
									period. While philosophy is often portrayed as armchair theorizing, and some certainly
									is, others ask important questions about how we should live our lives and make 
									difficult decisions. I am particularly interested in the Roman Stoic philosophers, whose
									virtue ethics emphasized the identification of what is within our control and was the basis
									for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.
								</p>
								<span class="icon solid fa-dice fa-lg">&nbsp;&nbsp;Games</span><br>
								<p>
									During graduate school, Dungeons and Dragons served as an important outlet for me and members
									of my research lab to unwind. I first played D&D as a child and have loved it ever since. I
									also enjoy a great variety of games, from strategy games to first person shooters.
