I have a wide variety of academic and work interests, and have run the gamut of
computer science subfields. I have a deep interest in computer security and the
methods for protecting users data. I greatly enjoy the process of analyzing
programs from an attackers view and finding creative solution to find and patch
vulnerabilities. Ultimately my interest in Computer Science is a philosophical
one of how to think through problems and answer tough questions.
