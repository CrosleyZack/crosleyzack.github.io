Since learning functional programming, I employ its techniques with growing regularity as a useful
methodology for solving data transformation driven problems. Clojure is the most functional programming
language I have used, but I reguarly apply the functional programming features of languages like Python
and Java to create simpler solutions. The navigation suite I developed for the Army is mostly functional,
with a Graph object that merely manages basic state information and all other methods being written
independent of the object. This has the extra benefit of enabling these methods to be repurposed by other
developers, who have used the resulting library for various projects. As part of my functional paradigm
exploration, I studied Okasaki's foundational paper Purely Functional Data Structures, and utilize his
techniques regularly to improve my code (lazy evaluation, memoization, and immutability). Recently I
have become interesting in the functional package manager Nix for system configuration and automation.
