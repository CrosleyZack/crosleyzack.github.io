My professional career has been spent with the Department of Defense working in the field of 
Computational Sciences, specifically Combat Modeling. My first job with the Navy involved development
of a deterministic, closed-form simulation used to evaluate aircraft Tactics, Techniques, and
Procedures (TTPs). This simulation mutated Subject Matter Expert (SME) encoded strategies across
a variety of scenarios to evaluate effectiveness of alternative TTPs. Our work involved not only
algorithm development but the maintenance of the two hundred node, Windows Server cluster computer
on which they were run. My work included performing updates and developing utilities for job
submission and server maintenance. My current job is working on an Army closed-form, Monte Carlo, 
discrete event combat simulator used for analysis of acquisition decisions. I have worked on defining
automated and intelligent behaviors for entities within the simulation as well as extending the
simulation to model new functionalities.
