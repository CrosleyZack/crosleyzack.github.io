I have always had a strong desire to understand the world. I have a 
passion for math and science as instruments for that understanding, and
read widely on these topics throughout my life. I wrote my first line of
code as a member of my high school Robotics team, and have been pursuing
it as a process for understanding how to think ever since. My appetite for
learning is just as strong today, and I am interested in a wide variety of
topics. I am always interested in solving unique and challenging problems,
usually with the aid of computer. If you have any such problems, contact me!
