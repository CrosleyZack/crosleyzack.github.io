During both my undergaduate and graduate degree I took multiple courses in artificial intelligence
techniques, including heuristic searches, classifiers, clustering, and reinforcement learning. My
graduate work included the mathematical foundations for algorithms like SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, Locality Sensitive Hashing, and Markov Decision Processes. My employment with the Navy
involved the development of genetic algorithms to optimize aircraft Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs). In my current employment with the Army, I have developed a navigation system which generates
a graph data structure from the terrain to enable intelligent path identification via heuristic
searches, like A* and Djikstra, and optimization techniques like Ant Colony Optimization. I have
also developed an architecture for Utility-driven AI which is used to define adaptive behaviors. The
methodology for my thesis research, inductive programming, an AI technique that uses Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) intersections to learn from examples.
