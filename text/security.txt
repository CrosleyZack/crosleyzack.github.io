In graduate school, I worked with the <a href="https://sefcom.asu.edu/">Security Engineering for Future
Computing (SEFCOM)</a> lab for my thesis and significant coursework. In classes led by SEFCOM faculty,
I learned the techniques for binary, web, and  network security. This included techniques like Buffer
Overflows, Format String exploits, Loop Overflows (Off-by-One exploits), Return Oriented Programming,
Spoofing (ARP, IP, TCP), Cross Site Scripting, and SQL Injection. I also learned the use of binary
reverse engineering tools like Ada. These techniques were employed with the Capture the Flag (CTF) team
the pwndevils. Pwndevils was established by Shellphish alumni and worked closely with the team, frequently
attending DEFCOM CTF events with them. My research project for my thesis was the application of inductive
programming techniques to exploit generation, which enabled the learning of basic expoits from examples
in a CTF environment. This research is ongoing and pending future publication. My current role with
Censys involves development of the Attack Surface Management Risks platform, which enables users to 
identify vulnerabilities in their internet facing devices. Using internet wide scan data, we identify
possible vulnerabilities, and display them to the user via a web portal and APIs.
