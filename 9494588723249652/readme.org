* About this problem
** What is this supposed to be?
The goal is to create an XSS vulnerability that when exploited in the correct way, produces the flag?
** Is XSS the only way to solve it?
No. Because this website is hosted by github.io, it has no server side code. This means all elements needed for the solution are on the users
computer, which allows it to be solved in the browser debugger or by de-obfuscating the javascript. Hopefully it is still fun though!
** What is the intended solution?
<script>decrypt(document.getElementById("flag").innerHTML)</script>
